## Python and Data Centric Development Milestone Project
A demo of this project can be viewed [here](https://tgc07-project03.herokuapp.com/).
The sample user log in details below can be used to demo the project:
| Email | Password | Access Rights |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| admin@email.com | password123 | administrator |
| limited@email.com | password123 | limited |

This website has been designed for PC hardware enthusiasts to post their reviews on PC components. The general public are able read the reviews for free, without any requirement to login. However, to post a review, comment, or vote, registation for a user account and login are required.

The site owner is assumed to be part of the Amazon affiliate programme, enabling the website to earn affiliate referral income from any click-throughs to product purchases. 

### Disclaimer
Most, if not all, of the external links in this project direct towards actual Amazon products, however **the affiliate referral modifiers are not genuine**.

## UX

### Strategy - User Stories
Members of the public would use the website to:
- Browse reviews of PC components to make more informed decisions when buying PC products.
- Read comments made on reviews to understand other people's views and opinions.
- Post reviews to be help the PC enthusiast community.
- Post comments to share personal experiences and opinions on PC products.
- Help the PC entusiast community members with any troubleshooting problems they may have encountered.
- Easily make purchases of products via the linked product pages.
- Vote up or down if they like or dislike a review.

Owners of the website would like to:
- Earn referral income on purchases that arise from click-throughs of the site's affiliate links.
- Be able to moderate the site content via admin accounts that can edit and delete reviews and comments, to maintain a friendly and welcoming environment for all users.
- Also be users of the site, by posting and reading reviews/comments related to PC components.

![Mobile reviews page](report/screenshots/reviews-mobile.png "Mobile reviews page")

### Scope
Content requirements:
- images of PC components being reviewed
- text for review content
- URLs to Amazon product pages
- icons for vote feature

Functional specification:
- vote buttons need to be able to function without requiring page to reload
- pages to separate reviews into manageable sizes so that each web page does not get too long

### Structure
The website structure will be presented using the hierarchical model. Main sections will be:
- review threads - summary page of all reviews at the top, accessible by anyone, leading to multiple individual reviews
- categories - summary of all categories and sub-categories, only accessible by admin users, with create, update, delete links accessible from here
- users - summary table of all users, only accessible by admin users, with create, update, delete links accessible from here

### Skeleton
Wireframes for the reviews summary page and individual reviews can be viewed [here](report/wireframes). A HTML table will be used to display all the users in the admin panel.

### Surface
Functionality and clarity was the main focus and reason behind the colour scheme and typography choice, as it was assumed that PC hardware enthusiasts would place preference on these aspects. If there had been more time, the colour scheme and styling should be revisited.

## Features

### Current Features
#### PC Component Reviews
- Ability to read all reviews, without needing to sign up for user account.
- Create, update, delete reviews that were written by yourself.
- Sort reviews by chronological order, reverse chronological order, price (low to high), price (high to low).
- Search reviews by category, sub-category and search box to query review title, review description or comments.
- Vote up or down on reviews if user has an account and is logged in, without need to reload page.
- Clicking a vote button will check if user has previously voted. If user had previously voted on same button currently clicked, then this latest action will remove the vote. If user had previously voted on the opposite vote button, then the opposite vote previously cast will be removed and the new vote cast.
- Update and delete any reviews if user has admin rights.
- Create and update review thread forms include validation steps that must be passed before being able to proceed. If there are errors, all input fields will be pre-populated with previously entered data on page reload.

#### Review Comments
- Ability to read all comments, without needing to sign up for user account.
- Create, update, delete comments that were written by yourself.

#### User accounts
- Sign up for user account, log in, log out.
- Update and delete user account details for user's own account.
- Update and delete any user account details if user has admin rights.
- Add or remove admin rights to users if current logged in user has admin rights.
- User log in and sign up forms include validation steps that must be passed before being able to proceed. If there are errors all fields except for password will be pre-populated on page reload.
- Create, update, delete categories and sub-categories if user has admin rights.

### Features Left to Implement:
- Ability to apply simple formatting of the review and comments text by using a library such as [Summernote](https://summernote.org/).
- Add search and pagination to page displaying reviews by specified user.
- Separate user profile update fields, so that each field can be updated individually.
- Quote other comments previously posted.
- Sort by most up-voted or down-voted reviews.
- Stop word filtering to automatically remove pre-determined list of bad words from reviews and comments before they get posted.
- Check if username and email are unique before allowing user to create or update to them.
- Check if categories and sub-categories are unique before allowing admin user to create or update to them.
- Improve mobile responsiveness.

- .env file was used to store environment variables so that Flask secret key and database credentials were not publicly viewable.

## Database Design
The ER diagram for this project's database can be viewed [here](report/erd/erd.png)

Three MongoDB collections were used:
1. Users
2. Categories - sub-categories were embedded in documents of the categories collection
3. Threads (Reviews) - comments were embedded in documents of the threads collection

### Sample MongoDB documents
Sample database document for user:
```

	"_id": {
		"$oid": "5f486a62d227fba8090e835b"
	},

	"terms_and_conditions": true,
	"marketing": true,
	"is_admin": false
}
```

Sample database document for category and embedded sub-categories:
```

```

Relationships between the review threads and categories and optional sub-categories were implemented using a hybrid approach, whereby _id and respective names were stored as nested objects within the review thread's document.

Relationships between the review threads and users were implemented using a hybrid approach, whereby _id and respective usernames were stored as nested objects within the review thread's document.

Comments were embedded as array elements within the review thread documents, with the respective user's _id and username also captured here.

Up-votes and down-votes were stored as separate arrays embedded within each review thread document. When a user votes, their user _id is stored as an element within the relevant up-vote or down-vote array. Before the user _id is stored, a check is performed to see if the user had previously voted. If user had previously voted on same button currently clicked, then this latest action will remove the vote. If user had previously voted on the opposite vote button, then the opposite vote previously cast will be removed and the new vote cast.

## Deployment
A live demo of this project can be viewed [here](https://tgc07-project03.herokuapp.com/).
All the source code for this project is available [here](https://github.com/andrewsui/tgc07-project03) on GitHub.

Code for the project was committed to GitHub in the following manner:
- Individual files were added to the next commit staging area by executing the `git add <filename>` command in a command-line interface.
- All changes in the working directory were added to the next commit (stage) by executing the `git add .` command in a command-line interface.
- Staged content was committed as new commit snapshot by executing the `git commit -m “<message>"` command in a command-line interface.
- Local branch commits were pushed to the remote repository master branch by executing the `git push -u origin master` command in a command-line interface.
- Subsequent local branch commits were pushed to the remote repository master branch by executing the `git push` command in a command-line interface.

Deployment to Heroku was performed in a debian based linux environment bash terminal in the following manner:
- Install Heroku on local machine: `sudo snap install heroku --classic`
- Log into Heroku: `heroku login -i`
- Create a new heroku app: `heroku create <app-name>`
- Verify that the correct remotes have been added: `git remote -v`
- Setup a python virtual environment in the root folder of the project: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the python virtual environment whilst being in the root folder of the project: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install the dependencies: `pip install dnspython Flask Flask-Login gunicorn passlib pymongo python-dotenv`
- Create requirements.txt file to store dependencies `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Using a file manager:
- Create a file named `Procfile` without speech-marks or file extension and save `web gunicorn <main flask file name without .py>:app` on the first line of `Procfile` (in my case, the contents of the Procfile was `web gunicorn app:app`)

Using a web browser:
- Log into [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and set environment variables for `SECRET_KEY = <your own key>`, `MONGO_URI = <your MongoDB URI>`

Back in the bash terminal:
- Commit all new changes to GitHub: `git add .` then `git commit -m “<message>"` then `git push`
- Finally, push to Heroku: `git push heroku master`

## Run locally on your own machine on debian based linux OS
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/andrewsui/tgc07-project03)
- Setup a python virtual environment in the root folder of the project: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the python virtual environment whilst in the root folder of the project: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- In root folder of project, create a `.env` file and set the following environment variables: `export SECRET_KEY = <your own key>`, `export MONGO_URI = <your MongoDB URI>`, `export PORT = <your chosen port>`
- Run the web app `python app.py`
- Use a web browser to navigate to `localhost:<your chosen port>`
